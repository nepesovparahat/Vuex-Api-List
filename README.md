## Vuex Product List
Using vue and vuex, I made a small project where changes can be made to the listing of API data.This project lists the data received from an API, adding data to these data with the input field, and deleting it by clicking the delete icon. It can filter these data with the help of dropdown. Also, it changes the background color when every item is clicked.
